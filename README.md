# predictive_maintenance

##Project Overview
This project implements a Predictive Maintenance system using Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of equipment failure or malfunction in industrial machinery. By analyzing historical data of machine sensors, maintenance logs, and operational conditions, this system aims to predict when a machine is likely to require maintenance, minimizing downtime, reducing operational costs, and improving asset lifespan.

##Key Features
-Data Collection: Utilizes sensor data to track machine health.
-Predictive Models: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict failure or need for maintenance.
-Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors machine conditions to predict future breakdowns.
-Cost Reduction: Helps in planning maintenance proactively, reducing unplanned downtime.

##Dataset
The project uses historical machine data, including sensor readings and failure history, to train the machine learning models. 
The dataset includes:
Sensor Readings: Temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.
Maintenance Logs: History of maintenance events.
Failure Events: Data related to past machine failures.
Note: The dataset used in this project can be replaced with real-time sensor data for live predictions.

##Machine Learning Model
The system employs several machine learning algorithms for prediction:
-Random Forest
-Decision Tree
-Logistic Regression
-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
These models are trained using historical data to predict failures or maintenance needs based on the features.

##How It Works
-Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are scaled.
-Feature Engineering: Key features such as machine age, sensor readings, and environmental conditions are selected.
-Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms are trained and tuned to select the best performing model.
-Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the probability of machine failure or maintenance events based on real-time sensor data.
-Visualization: The system provides a user interface to view the status and health of machines.

##Results and Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like:
-Accuracy
-Confusion Metric

Future Improvements
-Integration with real-time sensor data.
-Use deep learning models for more complex prediction tasks.
-Incorporate external factors such as environmental conditions or operational changes.
-Develop a mobile application for real-time alerts and notifications.
